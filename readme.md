An attempt to learn CSS Grid

Used [This Repository](https://github.com/kevin-powell/learn-grid-the-easy-way) Following [This tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU&t=138s). As practice, I created everything from scratch. I did not copy the base code and instead wrote it myself, hence why I didn't fork the repository.
